=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Music::BachChoralHarmony;

  my $bach = Music::BachChoralHarmony->new;
  my $songs = $bach->parse;

  # show all the song ids:
  print Dumper [keys %$songs];

  # show all the song titles:
  print Dumper [ map{ $songs->{$_}{title} } keys %$songs];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Music::BachChoralHarmony> parses the UCI Bach choral harmony data set of 60
chorales.

This module does a few simple things:

1. It turns the UCI CSV data into a perl data structure.

2. It converts the UCI YES/NO note specification into a bit string.

3. It combines the Bach BWV number, song title and key with the data.

The BWV and titles were collected from an old Internet Archive of
C<jsbchorales.net>.  The keys were computed with a C<music21> program.
Check out the links in the L</SEE ALSO> section.

See the C<eg/> programs for usage examples.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 data_file

The local file where the Bach choral harmony data set resides.

Default: B<dist_dir()>/jsbach_chorals_harmony.data

=cut

has data_file => (
    is      => 'ro',
    default => sub { dist_dir('Music-BachChoralHarmony') . '/' .  'jsbach_chorals_harmony.data' },
);

=head2 key_title

The local file where the key signatures and titles for each song are listed by
BWV number (with a few unfortunate gaps).

Default: B<dist_dir()>/jsbach_BWV_keys_titles.txt

=cut

has key_title => (
    is      => 'ro',
    default => sub { dist_dir('Music-BachChoralHarmony') . '/' . 'jsbach_BWV_keys_titles.txt' },
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

  $bach = Music::BachChoralHarmony->new(%arguments);

Create a new C<Music::BachChoralHarmony> object.

=head2 parse()

  $songs = $bach->parse();

Parse the B<data_file> and B<key_title> files into a hash reference of each song
keyed by the song id.  Each song includes a BWV identifier, title, key and list
of events.  The event list is made of hash references with keys for the notes
bit string, bass note, the accent value and the resonating chord.
